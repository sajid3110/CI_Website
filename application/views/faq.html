      <summary>1. How much do your wedding films cost?</summary>
      <p>Most of the budgeting depend upon the size and type of the wedding. Each wedding
film is customisable as per your requirements. We take into consideration a lot of
factors including your story, personality and how much of the wedding you want to
remember. The cost also depends upon the size of crew and number of days of the
wedding. Added services such as a personalised soundtrack, aerial videography,
on-site edits and any other special requirements would be an additional cost. Having
said that, each wedding is unique and your films could cost a little less, or much
more. Our approach to film-making and budgeting isn't quite as cut dry as a
'package' or 'fixed price'. So whether you're having a Bollywood style grand
production or an intimate backyard wedding, we'd like to treat it with the poignancy
and grandeur it deserves. Write to us and we'll do our best to make it work for you.

      <summary>2. Do you offer same day edits?
</summary>
      <p>We do offer same-day edits, but it is not something we recommend because a
hurried edit may not have the same amount of heart and passion in the film
compared to a complete post production process. Besides, we have been told that
when it comes to our films, it is worth the wait.
