But what we really do is play with the visual medium to tell interesting stories across genres - be it capturing uncontrived moments on ‘the’ big day of your life, a corporate ad that needs to connect with your audience, or celebrate the arrival of your little one - we use the simple craft of storytelling to put words and frames to your emotions. We have worked primarily with a diverse set of verticals such as Real Estate, Automobile, Hospitality, Tourism, E-commerce, Fashion, and more. </p>
                          <p class="desc-text offspace-20">Simply put, we do what we do because that is what makes our soul jump with joy. We strive toward evoking a similar emotion from those who work with us.</p>

More importantly, we love the fact that we get to be involved in making your big day special. We integrate the documentary style of filmmaking into our wedding films, well, because every union of two beautiful souls has a different story to tell.  </p>

We capture and document the entire process of motherhood – right from the pregnancy phase to the birth – and compile it to create a timeline of this beautiful progression. We also capture the innocent expressions of your newborn in a creative yet safe setting, to freeze these precious and irretrievable moments for posterity. </p>
